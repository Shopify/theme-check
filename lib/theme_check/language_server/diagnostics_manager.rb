      # This class exists to facilitate LanguageServer diagnostics tracking.

      # Motivations:
      #   1. The first time we lint, we want all the errors from all the files.
      #   2. If we fix all the errors in a file, we have to send an empty array for that file.
      #   3. If we do a partial check, we should consider the whole theme diagnostics as valid, and return cached results
      #   4. We should be able to create WorkspaceEdits from diagnostics, so that the ExecuteCommandEngine can do its job
      #   5. We should clean up diagnostics that were applied by the client
