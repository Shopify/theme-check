    # Motivations:
    #   - Need way for LanguageServer to know on which version of a file
    #     the check was run on, because we need to know where the
    #     TextEdit goes. If the text changed, our TextEdit might not be
    #     in the right spot. e.g.
    #
    #     Example:
    #
    #     ```
    #     Hi
    #     {{world}}
    #     ```
    #
    #     Would produce two "SpaceInsideBrace" errors:
    #
    #     - One after {{ at index 5 to 6
    #     - One before }} at index 10 to 11
    #
    #     If the user goes in and changes Hi to Sup, and _then_
    #     right clicks to apply the code edit at index 5 to 6, he'd
    #     get the following:
    #
    #     ```
    #     Sup
    #     { {world}}
    #     ```
    #
    #     Which is not a fix at all.
    #
    # Solution:
    #   - Have the LanguageServer store the version on textDocument/did{Open,Change,Close}
    #   - Have ThemeFile store the version right after @storage.read.
    #   - Add version to the diagnostic meta data
    #   - Use diagnostic meta data to determine if we can make a code edit or not
    #   - Only offer fixes on "clean" files (or offer the change but specify the version so the editor knows what to do with it)
